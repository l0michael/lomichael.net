title: About
---

I'm Michael Lo, a [Master's student](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) of the [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I currently work as an independent researcher, focused on software security and AI safety. If you are interested in working together, please feel free to contact me.

I enjoy participating in Capture-the-Flag competitions (CTFs) and currently compete with [GreyHat @ GT](https://greyhat.gatech.edu). I specialize in binary exploitation (pwn) and reverse engineering (rev).

Outside of work, I enjoy reading books, board and card games, racket sports, and time with my family and church.
